# Yahtzee Volition

Yahtzee Volition is played with the same core mechanics as standard Yahtzee: five dice, up to **three total rolls per turn**, and after the third roll the player must assign the result to one open category on their scorecard. The game ends when all categories have been filled.

What makes Yahtzee Volition different is the addition of (1) pre–game prediction scoring, and (2) *Volition bonuses* that reward committing to a category family and completing them sequentially.

## 1) Pre-Game Prediction

Before rolling any dice, the player must **predict the parity or divisibility** of their future Sub-Total (the subtotal of all categories before bonuses):

The player checks **one** of the following prediction boxes:

- **Even** total
- **Odd** total
- **Divisible by 5**
- **Divisible by 10**

After the game, if the actual Sub-Total satisfies the chosen condition, the player receives the indicated prediction bonus printed on the scorecard.

## 2) Volition Categories

The scorecard is divided into **three Volitions**:

### Volition 1 — Restriction
- Only Odd
- Only Even
- Only Prime

### Volition 2 — Summation
- Sum of 17 or 18
- Sum is a Perfect Square (9, 16, or 25)

### Volition 3 — Discretion
- Palindrome
- All Different Numbers
- High–Low Mix (only 1s and 6s, at least one of each)
- Chance (sum of all dice)
- Yahtzee (five of a kind)

Each category is scored using the printed fixed point value or scoring rule next to the category on the sheet.

Once a category is used, it may not be used again in future turns.

## 3) Volition Streak Bonuses (Sequential Commitment)

You may earn bonus points by completing **categories from the same Volition in consecutive turns**.

- **Volition 1 Streak Bonus**  
  If a player fills **all three** Volition 1 categories in **three consecutive turns**, they score **+40 points**.

- **Volition 2 Streak Bonus**  
  If a player fills **both** Volition 2 categories in **two consecutive turns**, they score **+40 points**.

Dots printed near these sections are used to track the streak as categories are filled in order.  
If the streak is broken (player scores a category outside that Volition during the streak), the streak resets.

**Volition 3 does not award streak bonuses.**

## 4) Scoring and End of Game

Once all categories are filled:

1. Compute the **Sub-Total** (sum of all filled category scores before bonuses).
2. Apply any earned **Volition streak bonuses**.
3. Evaluate the **Pre-Game Prediction** and apply the corresponding prediction bonus if satisfied.
4. The total after applying all bonuses is the **Grand Total**.

Highest Grand Total wins.

## 5) Notes and Clarifications

- All dice rules (rolls, keeping dice between rolls, exactly three chances per turn) are identical to standard Yahtzee procedure.
- Palindrome means the five dice can be **reordered** into a symmetric pattern (a b c b a). It is a multiset property, not an order-of-roll property.
- High–Low Mix requires all five dice to be either 1 or 6, with at least one of each.
- “Only Odd”, “Only Even”, and “Only Prime” categories require all five dice to satisfy that property.
